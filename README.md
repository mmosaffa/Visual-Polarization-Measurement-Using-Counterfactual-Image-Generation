# Visual-Polarization-Measurement-Using-Counterfactual-Image-Generation
This paper, we introduce the Polarization Measurement Using Counterfactual Image Generation (PMCIG) method, which combines economic theory with generative models and multi-modal deep learning to fully utilize the richness of image data and provide a theoretically grounded measure of polarization in visual content.
